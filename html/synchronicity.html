                <h2>🌱 What Is The Synchronicity Engine?</h2>
                <p>The Synchronicity Engine is not an escape from reality—it is an <strong>augmentation</strong> of it. It's a decentralized, sacred gifting economy that transforms human attention into tokens of gratitude, creating a regenerative ecosystem where:</p>

                <div>
                    <div>
                        <h3>🌱 Self</h3>
                        <p>Is cultivated through focus and discipline</p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <h3>🤝 Other</h3>
                        <p>Is nurtured through love and support</p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <h3>🌍 Planet</h3>
                        <p>Is regenerated through stewardship of land, water, and all beings</p>

                <h2>⚖️ Core Principles</h2>

                <div>
                    <h4>The Game of Harmony</h4>
                    <p>This is no zero-sum competition. <strong>Bad behavior is a losing strategy.</strong> The Engine rewards cooperation, harmony, and service to the whole. The players who shine brightest are those who align most deeply with Self, Other, and Planet.</p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <h4>Attention as Sacred Currency</h4>
                    <p><strong>Where attention goes, energy flows and reality grows.</strong> The Engine treats human attention as the most sacred resource. When you focus on an intention—whether for minutes or hours—that attention becomes stored potential energy that can later be transformed into tokens of gratitude.</p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <h4>Sacred Economics Over Extraction</h4>
                    <p>Unlike systems that extract value, The Synchronicity Engine creates abundance through:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Zero transfer fees</strong> - gratitude flows freely without friction</li>
                        <li><strong>Community ownership</strong> - infrastructure owned by Temples, not corporations</li>
                        <li><strong>Regenerative focus</strong> - every action serves the healing of Self, Other, and Planet</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <h2>🔄 How It Works: The Sacred Lifecycle</h2>

                <div>
                    <div>
                        <h4>1. 💭 Intentions Emerge</h4>
                        <p>Anyone can declare a dream—a vision of what they want to see in the world:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>"Build solar dehydrator this weekend"</li>
                            <li>"Create neighborhood food forest"</li>
                            <li>"Establish community tool library"</li>
                            <li>"Learn permaculture design"</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>

                    <div>
                        <h4>2. 🧠 Attention Flows</h4>
                        <p>Each person directs their focused attention to one intention at a time. The system tracks these "attention switch events"—when you begin focusing on something new. This creates a personal log of how you've invested your most precious resource: your conscious attention.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div>
                        <h4>3. 🛠️ Service Anchors the Dream</h4>
                        <p>When someone acts on an intention and provides evidence—photos, videos, stories—this becomes a <strong>Proof of Service</strong>. The community is notified that the vision is moving from dream into reality.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div>
                        <h4>4. ✨ Gratitude Crystallizes into Tokens</h4>
                        <p>Here's where the magic happens. Anyone who previously focused attention on that intention can now <strong>consciously forge</strong> their stored attention into <strong>Tokens of Gratitude</strong>.</p>
                        <p>Each token contains:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The total duration of focused attention that created it</li>
                            <li>Which intention it honors</li>
                            <li>Which proof of service it recognizes</li>
                            <li>A personal message of gratitude</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>

                    <div>
                        <h4>5. 🔄 Sacred Exchange</h4>
                        <p>These tokens become <strong>sacred currency</strong> that can be:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Gifted to recognize beautiful service</li>
                            <li>Exchanged for offerings like workshops, meals, or help</li>
                            <li>Used to access shared resources in Temple vaults</li>
                            <li>Traded for music, art, or other gifts from community members</li>
                        </ul>
